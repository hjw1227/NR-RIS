# SecureCoder: DRL-Based Robust Precoder Design Against Malicious NR-RIS
This repository contains the implementation of SecureCoder, an enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for robust precoder design in wireless networks against malicious Non-Reflective Intelligent Surface (NR-RIS) attacks. The solution leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize communication precoders, ensuring resilience against intentional interference from malicious RIS elements.
